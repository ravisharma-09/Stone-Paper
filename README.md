🪨 Stone-Paper-Scissor Game

This is a simple and fun Stone-Paper-Scissor game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player selects an option, and the computer randomly chooses one, then the result (Win, Lose, or Tie) is displayed instantly.

It’s a beginner-friendly project made to practice JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and basic UI design.![Screenshot 2026-02-26 at 9 27 37 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f13ebe6b-0d51-4d36-a636-0a8a2445fa2f)
